#CAVEATS

- FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)

    - To make the hot reloading of CSS work, we are not extracting CSS in development. Ideally, during server rendering, we will be extracting CSS, and we will get a .css file, and we can use it in the html template. That's what we are doing in production. 
    - In development, after all scripts get loaded, react loads the CSS as BLOBs. That's why there is a second of FOUC in development.
- No Support for Windows Development

    - This is not tested for Windows development and 
    currently does not support any Windows OS.

#INSTALL

- run `git clone https://github.com/donmclean/riko.git`
- cd into the cloned directory by running `cd riko`
- run `npm install`
- grab ~~coffee~~ a redbull

#USAGE

- After installation you can run either of the following two options: 
    - `npm run setup` to setup the most basic content to jump start your application.
    - `npm run setup-js` to setup a non html templated project. For example a js module or library project.
    - `npm run setup-mobile` to setup sample content of a react native mobile application.<br/><br/>
        **NOTE: _WHEN SETTING UP A MOBILE (REACT NATIVE) APP ON MAC_**<br/>
        - You must have [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode), a valid [iOS simulator](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/iOS_Simulator_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), and [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [JRE](https://java.com/en/download/) installed.<br/>
        - You must have [brew](http://brew.sh/) installed.<br/>
    - `npm run setup-electron` to setup sample content of an electron application.<br/><br/>
        **NOTE: _WHEN SETTING UP AN ELECTRON APP ON MAC_**<br/>
        - You must have [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) installed.<br/>
        - You must successfully run `sh src/electron.sh` to be able to package a windows version of your app.<br/>
        - If this fails you should complete the following instructions:<br/>
        [Install Wine on Mac](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/) to package a windows version of your app.
 
> Run `npm run setup-js` to start create a js module/library project.<br/> 
> Or run a `npm run setup` when you're ready to start a web application.<br/> 
> Or run a `npm run setup-mobile` when you're ready to start a mobile application.<br/> 
> Or run a `npm run setup-electron` if you're building an electron application.
 
- After running one of the setup commands notice there is a new `src/` folder in the directory. 
- here is where all of your source code will live. From js source/test scripts to stylesheets to custom eslinters etc.

#### **THE 'custom-config.js' FILE**

- **NOTE**: This is **NOT** available if you ran `npm run setup-mobile`. The `custom-config.js` is only for **JS Module, WEB & Electron Applications.**
- This is where all your settings live. The build system has been created so you rarely have to enter the webpack.config.js file.
- Here's the run down:

Root Directory. **IMPORTANT! DO NOT OVERRIDE!**
```javascript
const baseDir                   = path.resolve(__dirname, '../'); //IMPORTANT! DO NOT OVERRIDE!
```
Source Directory.
```javascript
config.srcDir                   = baseDir+"/src"; //IMPORTANT! DO NOT OVERRIDE!
```

That is your base/root & source directories; They're needed to keep the paths below relative. it's highly recommended that you keep this as is.

##### CUSTOM OPTIONS

**IMPORTANT!** All paths/directories should be relative to 'baseDir' unless specified otherwise. 
Also all values are required to exist and be same file type as in the following examples.
eg: `baseDir+'/path'`

config.moduleName               = 'riko';
```

Output location for all of your src files after a production build
```javascript
config.destDir                  = baseDir+"/dist"; 
```

Location for all for temp files to be stored on production build (this will be automatically deleted)
```javascript
config.tempDir                  = baseDir+"/temp";
```

Port your wish to serve your files on in dev mode
```javascript
config.EXPRESS_PORT             = 3000;
```

```javascript
config.eslintConfig             = baseDir+'/src/__linters/.eslintrc';
config.stylelintConfig          = baseDir+'/src/__linters/.stylelintrc.yaml';
config.packageJson              = baseDir+'/package.json';

```javascript
config.template_main_file_name  = 'index.html';
```

An html file with visual stats of the build will be added to each incremental build.
Specify the name for it here. The name will then be follow by a '-' the your current Git version
eg: `[name]-4bd933dd0d4ec24302ffb3e92dde767d31f7e392.html`

See [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/template-html-loader) and
[here](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js)
```javascript
config.template_engine          = ''; //eg: hbs, handlebars, ejs, mustache
```

Google Analytics is automatically setup in your setup `src/templates/index.pug` file.
Simply apply options. 
If you do not wish to use GA comment-out/remove the functionality `src/templates/in index.pug`
```javascript

config.gaTrackingId             = 'UA-XXXXX-Y';
config.gaPageViewOnLoad         = true;
```

##### MEDIA OPTIONS

**IMPORTANT!!! (THESE ARE ALREADY RELATIVE TO OUTPUT OR DESTINATION).
ALSO DO NOT ADD TRAILING SLASH '/'** 
<br/>eg: incorrect - `assets/audio/`
<br/>eg: correct - `assets/audio`

```javascript
config.media_audio_output_path  = 'assets/audio';
config.media_files_output_path  = 'assets/files'; //pdfs, docs, etc
config.media_fonts_output_path  = 'assets/fonts';
config.media_images_output_path = 'assets/images';
config.media_video_output_path  = 'assets/video';
```

**IMPORTANT!!!** Use absolute path here. Leave empty string if you don't want to use. 
```javascript
config.media_favicon_path       = baseDir+'/src/media/images/riko-favicon.png';
```

Image optimization options. NOTE: only valid on prod build. Leave empty if you don't want to use.
See [here](https://github.com/Klathmon/imagemin-webpack-plugin).
```javascript
config.imageminConfig = {
    // progressive: true,
    pngquant:{
        quality: '65-90',
        speed: 4
    },
    svgo:{
        plugins: [
            {
                removeViewBox: false
            },
            {
                removeEmptyAttrs: false
            }
        ]
    }
};
```

##### VENDOR OPTIONS
**IMPORTANT!!!** all module dependencies that are NOT npm installed modules
<br/>eg: `require('src/vendor/jquery.min.js')`
must be specified with it's valid ABSOLUTE path.
```javascript
config.externalModulePaths = {
    //eg: $ : 'src/vendor/jquery.min.js'
};
```

Add vendor dependencies that you wish to expose globally but not expose
to global/window object here.

If using an npm module. Use the same way as you would in a require statement.
<br/>`eg: _ : 'lodash'`

But if using a vendor dependency. Use the MATCHING KEY from `config.externalModulePaths`.
<br/>**IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT USE AN ABSOLUTE PATH.**
```javascript
//eg:   config.externalModulePaths  = {$ : 'src/vendor/jquery.min.js'};
//      config.externalModules      = {$: '$'};
```

Notice how the '$' value of `externalModules` matches the key $ of `externalModulePaths`.
```javascript
config.externalModules = {
    //eg: $ : 'jquery'
    //or: $ : '$' //if you're not using the npm module. Make sure path is mapped in config.externalModulePaths
};
```

To add vendor dependencies and expose them to global/window object simply use the expose-loader
`// eg: require("expose-loader?_!lodash");`
<br/>See: [here](https://github.com/webpack/expose-loader).

##### EXTRA OPTIONS

Define which sourcemap type here.
See [here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#devtool).
```javascript
config.sourcemapType = 'inline-source-map';
```
Enable of disable sourcemaps based on environment.
```javascript
config.sourcemapDev = true;
config.sourcemapProd = true;
```

Enable remote debugging via vorlon.js very useful for debugging on mobile devices.
Simply visit `localhost:1337` or browsersync's `[externalIp]:1337` in dev mode via `npm run dev`.
<br/>See here: [vorlon js](http://vorlonjs.com)
<br/>**WARNING**: js sourcemap info will not be able in browser console if enabled in dev mode.
<br/>**IMPORTANT!** this is only recommended if you're debugging a specific device or not using sourcemaps.
```javascript
config.enableRemoteDebugging   = true;
```

Set autoprefixing options here.
See [here](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#webpack).
```javascript
config.autoprefixerOptions     = { browsers: ['> 0%'] }; //prefix all
```

Set webpack middleware options for dev mode.
See [here](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware#config).
```javascript
config.hotReloadingOptions     = {
    overlay: true,
    reload: true,
    noInfo: false,
    quiet: false
};
```

Override hot module replacement and simply have the page refresh on file change.
```javascript
config.BrowserSyncReloadOnChange = true;
```

Enable this to have tests execute on every webpack rebuild.
```javascript
config.hotExecuteTests = false;
```

Add any shell command to execute around the production build lifecycle `npm run prod`.
<br/>**IMPORTANT!** must be and array. eg: `[ 'echo hello world' ]`;
```javascript
config.onBuildStartShellCommands = [];
config.onBuildEndShellCommands = [];
config.onBuildExitShellCommands = [];
```

Important linting options for prod build.
```javascript
config.failOnProdBuildJsError = true;
config.failOnProdBuildStyleError = false;
config.eslintQuietMode = false; //set false to display warnings based on your eslint config
```

#USAGE - CONTINUED

- After configuring everything in the `custom-config.js` file to your liking, you should now run the following commands: 
    - `npm run test-build`
        - This runs a test on the riko build to ensure that the build in still in working order.
        - You should also run this command regularly after making alterations to any of the config files.
    
    - `npm run prod`
        - This will execute a production build on your current src/ folder.
        - If this passes you should be in good shape to test it out.
        
    - `npm run electron-prod`
        - This will execute a production build on your current src/ folder.
        - It will create packager an electron application based on the configurations specified in the custom-config.js (electronPackagingOptions)
        
    - `npm run prod-server`
        - This will fire up an express server for you to test out your new prod build.
        - Remember to check for the visualizer file based on your git version to really see the build details.
        
    - `npm run server`
        - This will fire up a browsersync server for you to test out your new prod build.
        - Remember to check for the visualizer file based on your git version to really see the build details.
        - Also if you have remote debugging enabled you can visit on port 1337 via localhost or browsersync's external IP.
        
    - `npm run dev`
        - This will fire up a browsersync server for you with your specified hot reloading options.
        - It will watch all files attached down the tree of your specified entry file and "hot replace or reload" on change.
    
    - `npm run electron`
        - This will fire up a browsersync server for you with your specified hot reloading options in a native Mac/Windows/Linux window.
        - It will watch all files attached down the tree of your specified entry file and "hot replace or reload" on change
        - Get the right formatted logo `.icns` or `.ico` for your electron app [here](https://iconverticons.com/online/).
            
    - `npm run mobile-ios`
        - This will fire up an ios emulator and debugger on `localhost:8081/debugger-ui`.
        - It will watch all files attached down the tree of the specified entry file (`index.ios.js`) and you'll be able to enable or disable "hot replace or live reload" on change.
        - **WARNING**: Do not run this while Docker or any other virtual machine is running. 
        
    - `npm run mobile-android`
        - This will fire up an android emulator and debugger on `localhost:8081/debugger-ui`.
        - It will watch all files attached down the tree of the specified entry file (`index.android.js`) and you'll be able to enable or disable "hot replace or live reload" on change.
        - If this fails try running again or see [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.34/docs/getting-started.html).
        - **WARNING**: Do not run this while Docker or any other virtual machine is running.
     
    - `npm run mobile-test`
        - Execute any jest tests. The default jest test directory is: `src/__tests__`. You can change this via the `src/package.json` if you wish.
            
    - `npm run test-jest`
        - Execute any jest tests. The default jest test directory is: `src/__tests__`. You can change this via the `package.json` if you wish.

    - `npm test` or `npm run test` 
        - Runs full test suite. (all test commands)
        - All test coverage information will be located in: '[root]/test-coverage'
        
#### Happy Coding :)
