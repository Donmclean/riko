#CAVEATS

- FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)

    - To make the hot reloading of CSS work, we are not extracting CSS in development. Ideally, during server rendering, we will be extracting CSS, and we will get a .css file, and we can use it in the html template. That's what we are doing in production. 
    - In development, after all scripts get loaded, react loads the CSS as BLOBs. That's why there is a second of FOUC in development.
- No Support for Windows Development

    - This is not tested for Windows development and 
    currently does not support any Windows OS.

#INSTALL

- run `git clone https://github.com/donmclean/riko.git`
- cd into the cloned directory by running `cd riko`
- run `npm install`
- grab ~~coffee~~ a redbull

#USAGE

- After installation you can run either of the following two options: 
    - `npm run setup` to setup the most basic content to jump start your application.
    - `npm run setup-js` to setup a non html templated project. For example a js module or library project.
    - `npm run setup-electron` to setup sample content of an electron application.<br/><br/>
        **NOTE: _WHEN SETTING UP AN ELECTRON APP ON MAC_**<br/>
        - You must have [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) installed.<br/>
        - You must successfully run `sh src/electron.sh` to be able to package a windows version of your app.<br/>
        - If this fails you should complete the following instructions:<br/>
        [Install Wine on Mac](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/) to package a windows version of your app.
 
> Run `npm run setup-js` to start create a js module/library project. 
> Or run a `npm run setup` when you're ready to start a web application.
> Or run a `npm run setup-electron` if you're building an electron application.
 
- After running one of the setup commands notice there is a new `src/` folder in the directory. 
- here is where all of your source code will live. From js source/test scripts to stylesheets to custom eslinters etc.

#### **THE 'custom_config.js' FILE**

- This is where all your settings live. The build system has been created so you rarely have to enter the webpack.config.js file.
- Here's the run down:

```javascript
//Root Directory
const baseDir                   = path.resolve(__dirname, '../'); //IMPORTANT! DO NOT OVERRIDE!

//Source Directory
config.srcDir                   = baseDir+"/src"; //IMPORTANT! DO NOT OVERRIDE!
```

That is your base/root & source directories; They're needed to keep the paths below relative. it's highly recommended that you keep this as is.

##### CUSTOM OPTIONS

```javascript
//IMPORTANT! All paths/directories should be relative to 'baseDir' unless specified otherwise. 
//Also all values are required to exist and be same file type as in the following examples.
// eg: baseDir+'/path'

//alias for your web application
config.moduleName               = 'riko';

//output location for all of your src files after a production build
config.destDir                  = baseDir+"/dist"; 

//location for all for temp files to be stored on production build (this will be automatically deleted)
config.tempDir                  = baseDir+"/temp";

//port your wish to serve your files on in dev mode
config.EXPRESS_PORT             = 3000;

//location of which to server production built files. (should* be same as destDir)
config.EXPRESS_ROOT             = config.destDir; 

//absolute paths to the configs/json files
config.eslintConfig             = baseDir+'/src/__linters/.eslintrc';
config.stylelintConfig          = baseDir+'/src/__linters/.stylelintrc.yaml';
config.packageJson              = baseDir+'/package.json';
```

##### ELECTRON OPTIONS
```javascript
//for Electron Applications Only. Attach any option to the electronPackagingOptions object. 
//See here: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md#options 

config.electronPackagingOptions = {};
```

config.js_main_entry_path       = baseDir+'/src/js/'+config.js_main_file_name;

//Relative path for your js bundle after prod build 
config.js_output_path           = 'assets/js';

    }
];

//Any configurations that you would like to be available in your application goes here.
//These values will be availbe when your source code builds and is runs.

config.template_main_file_name  = 'index.html';

//An html file with visual stats of the build will be added to each incremental build.
//specify the name for it here. The name will then be follow by a '-' the your current Git version
//eg: [name]-4bd933dd0d4ec24302ffb3e92dde767d31f7e392.html
//See: https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/
config.template_stats_file_name = '';

//Absolute path for your main source template.
config.template_src_path        = baseDir+'/src/templates/index.pug';

//if you're using a custom template engine 'OTHER THAN' pug or html
//add as string below.
//https://www.npmjs.com/package/template-html-loader
//https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js
config.template_engine          = ''; //eg: hbs, handlebars, ejs, mustache

//Google Analytics is automatically setup in your setup src/templates/index.pug file.
//Simply apply options. 
//If you do not wish to use GA comment-out/remove the functionality src/templates/in index.pug
config.gaEnable                 = true;
config.gaTrackingId             = 'UA-XXXXX-Y';
config.gaPageViewOnLoad         = true;
```

##### MEDIA OPTIONS

// IMPORTANT!!! (THESE ARE ALREADY RELATIVE TO OUTPUT OR DESTINATION)
// ALSO DO NOT ADD TRAILING SLASH '/' eg: assets/audio/

config.media_audio_output_path  = 'assets/audio';
config.media_files_output_path  = 'assets/files'; //pdfs, docs, etc
config.media_fonts_output_path  = 'assets/fonts';
config.media_images_output_path = 'assets/images';
config.media_video_output_path  = 'assets/video';

// IMPORTANT!!! Use absolute path here. Leave empty string if you don't want to use. 
config.media_favicon_path       = baseDir+'/src/media/images/riko-favicon.png';

//Image optimization options. NOTE: only valid on prod build. Leave empty if you don't want to use.
//See: https://github.com/Klathmon/imagemin-webpack-plugin
config.imageminConfig = {
    // progressive: true,
    pngquant:{
        quality: '65-90',
        speed: 4
    },
    svgo:{
        plugins: [
            {
                removeViewBox: false
            },
            {
                removeEmptyAttrs: false
            }
        ]
    }
};
```

##### VENDOR OPTIONS
```javascript
//IMPORTANT!!! all module dependencies that are NOT npm installed modules
// -  eg: require('src/vendor/jquery.min.js')
// must be specified with it's valid ABSOLUTE path here
config.externalModulePaths = {
    //eg: $ : 'src/vendor/jquery.min.js'
};

// add vendor dependencies that you wish to expose globally but not expose
// to global/window object here.
//
// If using an npm module. Use the same way as you would in a require statement.
// eg: _ : 'lodash'
//
// But if using a vendor dependency. Use the MATCHING KEY from config.externalModulePaths
// IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT USE AN ABSOLUTE PATH.
//
// eg:  config.externalModulePaths  = {$ : 'src/vendor/jquery.min.js'};
//      config.externalModules      = {$: '$'};
// Notice how the '$' value of externalModules matches the key $ of externalModulePaths
config.externalModules = {
    //eg: $ : 'jquery'
    //or: $ : '$' //if you're not using the npm module. Make sure path is mapped in config.externalModulePaths
};

// To add vendor dependencies and expose them to global/window object simply use the expose-loader
// eg: require("expose-loader?_!lodash");
// see: https://github.com/webpack/expose-loader

```

#USAGE - CONTINUED

- After configuring everything in the `custom_config.js` file to your liking, you should now run the following commands: 
    - `npm run test-build`
        - This runs a test on the riko build to ensure that the build in still in working order.
        - You should also run this command regularly after making alterations to any of the config files.
    
    - `npm run prod`
        - This will execute a production build on your current src/ folder.
        - If this passes you should be in good shape to test it out.
        
    - `npm run electron-prod`
        - This will execute a production build on your current src/ folder.
        - It will create packager an electron application based on the configurations specified in the custom-config.js (electronPackagingOptions)
        
    - `npm run prod-server`
        - This will fire up an express server for you to test out your new prod build.
        - Remember to check for the visualizer file based on your git version to really see the build details.
        
    - `npm run server`
        - This will fire up a browsersync server for you to test out your new prod build.
        - Remember to check for the visualizer file based on your git version to really see the build details.
        - Also if you have remote debugging enabled you can visit on port 1337 via localhost or browsersync's external IP.
        
    - `npm run dev`
        - This will fire up a browsersync server for you with your specified hot reloading options.
        - It will watch all files attached down the tree of your specified entry file and "hot replace or reload" on change.
    
    - `npm run electron`
        - This will fire up a browsersync server for you with your specified hot reloading options in a native Mac/Windows/Linux window.
        - It will watch all files attached down the tree of your specified entry file and "hot replace or reload" on change
        - Get the right formatted logo `.icns` or `.ico` for your electron app [here](https://iconverticons.com/online/).
        
    - `npm run test-jest`
        - Execute any jest tests. The default jest test directory is: `src/__tests__`. You can change this via the package.json if you wish.

    - `npm test` or `npm run test` 
        - Runs full test suite. (all test commands)
        - All test coverage information will be located in: '[root]/test-coverage'
        
#### Happy Coding :)
