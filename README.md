#CAVEATS

- FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)

    - To make the hot reloading of CSS work, we are not extracting CSS in development. Ideally, during server rendering, we will be extracting CSS, and we will get a .css file, and we can use it in the html template. That's what we are doing in production. 
    - In development, after all scripts get loaded, react loads the CSS as BLOBs. That's why there is a second of FOUC in development.

#INSTALL

- run `git clone https://github.com/donmclean/riko.git`
- cd into the cloned directory by running `cd riko`
- run `npm install`
- grab ~~coffee~~ a redbull

#USAGE

- After installation you can run either of the following two options: 
    - `npm run setup` to setup the most basic content to jump start your application.
    - `npm run setup-demo` to setup demo content to get a better sense of how testing, asset loading etc works within the build system. 
 
> It's recommended that you run a `npm run setup-demo` first and get a good feel for working with the build system. 
> Then run a `npm run setup` when you're ready to start your application.
 
- After running one of the setup commands notice there is a new `src/` folder in the directory. 
- here is where all of your source code will live. From js source/test scripts to stylesheets to custom eslinters etc.

#### **THE 'custom_config.js' FILE**

- This is where all your settings live. The build system has been created so you rarely have to enter the webpack.config.js file.
- Here's the run down:

```javascript
//Root Directory
const baseDir = process.cwd(); //IMPORTANT! DO NOT OVERRIDE!
```

That is your base/root directory and is needed to keep the paths below relative. it's highly recommended that you keep this as is.

##### CUSTOM OPTIONS

```javascript
//IMPORTANT! All paths/directories should be relative to 'baseDir' unless specified otherwise. 
//Also all values are required to exist and be same file type as in the following examples.
// eg: baseDir+'/path'

//alias for your web application
config.moduleName               = 'riko';

//output location for all of your src files after a production build
config.destDir                  = baseDir+"/dist"; 

//port your wish to serve your files on in dev mode
config.EXPRESS_PORT             = 3000;

//location of which to server production built files. (should* be same as destDir)
config.EXPRESS_ROOT             = config.destDir; 

//absolute paths to the configs/json files
config.eslintConfig             = baseDir+'/src/__linters/.eslintrc';

#USAGE - CONTINUED

- After configuring everything in the `custom_config.js` file to your liking, you should now run the following commands: 
    - `npm run test-build`
        - This runs a test on the riko build to ensure that the build in still in working order.
        - You should also run this command regularly after making alterations to any of the config files.
    
    - `npm run prod`
        - This will execute a production build on your current src/ folder.
        - If this passes you should be in good shape to test it out.
        
    - `npm run server`
        - This will fire up a browsersync server for you to test out your new prod build.
        - Remember to check for the visualizer file based on your git version to really see the build details.
        - Also if you have remote debugging enabled you can visit on port 1337 via localhost or browsersync's external IP.
        
    - `npm run dev`
        - This will fire up a browsersync server for you with your specified hot reloading options.
        - It will watch all files attached down the tree of your specified entry file and "hot replace or reload" on change
    
    - `npm run test-jest`
        - Execute any jest tests. The default jest test directory is: `src/__tests__`. You can change this via the package.json if you wish.
        
    - `npm run test-karma`
        - Execute any karma tests. The default karma test directory is: `src/tests`. You can change this via the karma.conf.js if you wish.
    
    - `npm run test-selenium`
        - Execute any selenium tests. The default selenium test directory is: `src/__tests_selenium`. You can change this via the nightwatch.json if you wish.
    
    - `npm test` or `npm run test` 
        - Runs full test suite. (all test commands)
        - All test coverage information will be located in: '[root]/test-coverage'
        
#### Happy Coding :)
